# Tft-Comp-Scanner
The was an application meant to build you a Comp in TfT set 8. This set had heroes so it was important to build your comp around them, in addition to the very powerful 'super' trait.

To use
Input the first 3 characters/more of the champion you want to include,
Such as 'Gan' = gangplank.
Once you've input the desired number of champions enter 'exit' to run the program.

The program will output suggested comps that use these champions and score them based on a weight of traits coded in by me, based on the meta at the time.
